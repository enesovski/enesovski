# Hey, I'm Enes Ceran

I'm a computer science student at Bilkent University, and I’ve been diving deep into game development over the past few years.

Right now, I’m working as a developer at [Artifika Games](https://artifikagames.com/), where we're building **Elysium** — a multiplayer survival game for PC platform.
